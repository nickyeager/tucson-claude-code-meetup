# Tucson Claude Code Meetup

A hands-on, 4-session course where you build **MeetupBot** — an AI-powered agent that helps organize AI developer meetups. You'll learn agent-building patterns that transfer to any project, using Claude Code and ngrok AI Gateway.

## Prerequisites

### Bootcamp Requirements
- **GitHub account** — create one at https://github.com/signup if you don't have one
- **AI-Trailblazers meetup membership** — join the group to get access to resources and stay connected
- **Claude Code account** — you need Claude Max or API access. If you don't have one, we'll provide access through the AI-Trailblazers meetup (we're subsidizing accounts for participants)
- **Consent to filming** — this bootcamp will be recorded and shared with the community

### Technical Setup
- Terminal/command line access
- Node.js installed (v18+)
- Git installed (we'll cover the basics)
- Text editor (VS Code recommended — has a Claude Code extension!)
- An LLM provider: Anthropic API key, Claude Max subscription, or ngrok AI Gateway (free tier)

> **Claude Code runs everywhere:** CLI (terminal), Desktop app (Mac/Windows), Web (`claude.ai/code`), VS Code extension, and JetBrains plugin. We use the CLI in this course, but all features work across all surfaces.

See [SETUP-GUIDE.md](sessions/SETUP-GUIDE.md) for detailed installation instructions.

### Verify Your Setup

Run these commands to confirm everything is installed:

```bash
node --version    # Should be v18+
git --version     # Any recent version
npm --version     # Should be v9+
```

If any command fails, install the missing tool before Session 1. Claude Code requires Node.js 18 or later.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install Claude Code
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

# 2. Create your project (you'll do this in Session 1)
mkdir meetup-agent && cd meetup-agent
git init

# 3. Launch Claude Code
claude
```

## Course Structure

| Session | Topic | What You Build | Reference Modules |
|---------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Fundamentals | Event planner with structured JSON output | [01-slash-commands](references/claude-howto/01-slash-commands), [02-memory](references/claude-howto/02-memory), [10-cli](references/claude-howto/10-cli) |
| 2 | Context Engineering | Comms + scheduling system via PRPs | [03-skills](references/claude-howto/03-skills), [09-advanced-features](references/claude-howto/09-advanced-features) |
| 3 | Subagents & Hooks | Specialist agents + automated review loop | [04-subagents](references/claude-howto/04-subagents), [06-hooks](references/claude-howto/06-hooks), [05-mcp](references/claude-howto/05-mcp) |
| 4 | Parallel Agents & Feedback | Competing variants + self-improving system | [07-plugins](references/claude-howto/07-plugins), [08-checkpoints](references/claude-howto/08-checkpoints) |

## Session Folders

Each `sessions/session-N/` folder contains:
- `EXERCISE.md` — step-by-step instructions for the session
- `SLIDES.md` — complete slide deck in markdown (presenter-ready)
- `SCRIPT.md` — speaker script with talking points, demo cues, and timing

## Sample Data

The `data/` folder contains sample data you can copy into your project:
- `venues.json` — 5 venues with capacity, amenities, and cost info
- `speakers.json` — 8 speakers with topics, availability, and ratings
- `sample-event-plan.json` — reference output showing the expected event plan format

## Solution / Reference Implementation

The `solution/` folder contains a complete MeetupBot implementation — one snapshot per session showing exactly what your project should look like after completing that session's exercises.

```
solution/
├── session-1/   # CLAUDE.md, data files, /plan-event command, sample output
├── session-2/   # + INITIAL.md, PRP, /build-schedule, /draft-announcement, /draft-speaker-outreach
├── session-3/   # + schedule-optimizer & comms-reviewer subagents, auto-review hook
└── session-4/   # + parallel variants, /post-event command, feedback loop, complete system
```

Use these to:
- **Compare your work** after each session checkpoint
- **Debug issues** when your output doesn't match expectations
- **Demo the finished product** before starting each session
- **Copy specific files** if you fall behind and need to catch up

Each session folder is self-contained — you can `cp -r solution/session-N/ my-project/` to reset to any checkpoint.

## Reference Materials

The `references/claude-howto/` directory contains the complete [Claude How-To](https://github.com/luongnv89/claude-howto) guides — 10 progressive tutorial modules with copy-paste templates, visual diagrams, and working examples for every Claude Code feature. Use these as deep-dive companions for each session.

The `templates/` directory contains context engineering templates adapted from the [Context Engineering Intro](https://github.com/coleam00/context-engineering-intro) — including `CLAUDE-starter.md` (a ready-to-use MeetupBot CLAUDE.md), `INITIAL.md` and `INITIAL_EXAMPLE.md` (feature request templates), and slash commands for the `/generate-prp` and `/execute-prp` workflow used in Session 2.

See the [Reference Guide](references/claude-howto/LEARNING-ROADMAP.md) for the full learning roadmap.

## The Project

By the end of Session 4, you'll have built:

```

## What You'll Learn

These patterns transfer to any agent project:

| Pattern | Session | Why It Matters |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| CLAUDE.md | 1 | Project rules that shape every AI response |
| Structured output | 1 | JSON schemas > freeform text for reliable agents |
| Context engineering | 2 | Complete blueprints > clever prompts |
| PRPs | 2 | Implementation specs with validation gates |
| Slash commands | 1-2 | Reusable, composable agent capabilities |
| Subagents | 3 | Specialists beat generalists |
| Hooks | 3 | Automate quality checks in the agent lifecycle |
| Parallel generation | 4 | Non-determinism becomes an advantage with evaluation |
| Feedback loops | 4 | Agents that learn from past results |
| Auto Mode | 1 | Classifier-based permissions — safe actions auto-approved |
| Conditional hooks | 3 | Target hooks to specific actions with `if` field |
| Routines | 4 | Cloud automations on schedule, GitHub events, or API calls |
| Effort controls | 1 | `/effort` and `/fast` for speed vs. reasoning depth |
| Agent SDK | 4 | Embed Claude Code agents in your own apps |

> **Scaling tip:** As your CLAUDE.md files grow across projects, [RuleMetric](https://github.com/nickyeager/momento-mori) helps manage instructions at scale — write once, convert to any AI tool format, and track what actually works.

## Course Progression

Each session builds directly on the previous one:

- **Session 1 → 2**: You'll go from manually prompting Claude to engineering complete context. The event plans you built with `/plan-event` become the structured data that powers Session 2's comms and scheduling pipeline. This is the key shift: *stop typing clever prompts, start building information systems.*
- **Session 2 → 3**: Your monolithic agent works, but it does everything mediocrely. Session 3 breaks it into specialists that each do one thing well — and wires hooks to automate quality checks you'd otherwise forget.
- **Session 3 → 4**: With specialists in place, you can now run them in parallel to generate competing solutions, evaluate objectively, and build a feedback loop that makes every future event better.

## LLM Provider Options

Claude Code needs an LLM provider. Pick whichever works for you — all exercises work identically:

| Option | Setup | Best For |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Anthropic API** | `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...` | Direct control, pay per token |
| **Claude Max** | Already logged in — auto-detected | Subscription users, zero config |
| **ngrok AI Gateway** | Free tier at ngrok.com, config in `config/ngrok-gateway.json` | Multi-provider routing, failover |

**Recommended for this course:** Direct Anthropic API key. It's the simplest setup and gives you full control.

ngrok AI Gateway is covered as an optional topic in Session 1 — it's useful for production setups where you want failover, cost routing, or PII redaction across multiple providers.
