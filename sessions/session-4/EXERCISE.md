# Session 4 Exercise: Parallel Subagents & The Feedback Loop

## Goal
Run parallel subagents to generate competing meetup plan variants, evaluate them with your Session 3 specialists, select the winner, and build a post-event feedback system that makes future events better.

## Step 1: Create a Meetup Brief (5 min)

Create `briefs/rag-workshop.md`:

```markdown
# Meetup Brief: RAG Workshop

**Topic:** Building Production RAG Pipelines
**Format:** Hands-on workshop
**Target attendees:** 40
**Duration:** 3 hours (evening, 6-9 PM)
**Audience level:** Intermediate Python developers with basic LLM experience
**Goals:** Attendees leave with a working RAG pipeline they can extend
**Constraints:** Venue must have WiFi and power outlets for all attendees
```

## Step 2: Run 3 Parallel Subagents (15 min)

Ask Claude to run 3 competing variants in parallel, each with a different strategy:

```
I need you to generate 3 competing event plans for the brief in briefs/rag-workshop.md.
Run these as 3 parallel subagents, each with a different optimization strategy:

1. "Community-first" — optimize for networking, community building, and beginner accessibility. More breaks, ice-breakers, group exercises.

2. "Deep-dive" — optimize for maximum technical depth. Longer talk slots, advanced content, live coding demos, minimal breaks.

3. "Workshop-lab" — optimize for hands-on learning. Short intros followed by guided exercises, pair programming, mentor stations.

For each variant:
- Read the brief at briefs/rag-workshop.md
- Read data/venues.json and data/speakers.json
- Generate a complete event plan JSON following CLAUDE.md schema
- Generate a schedule
- Draft an announcement email

Save outputs to:
- events/rag-workshop-v1-community.json, schedules/rag-workshop-v1.md, comms/rag-workshop-v1-announcement.md
- events/rag-workshop-v2-deepdive.json, schedules/rag-workshop-v2.md, comms/rag-workshop-v2-announcement.md
- events/rag-workshop-v3-lab.json, schedules/rag-workshop-v3.md, comms/rag-workshop-v3-announcement.md

Run all 3 in parallel using subagents.
```

> **What's happening under the hood:** Claude Code uses git worktrees to give each subagent an isolated copy of your repo. They run simultaneously without stepping on each other's files. You don't need to manage the git branches — Claude handles it.

## Step 3: Evaluate Each Variant (10 min)

Use your Session 3 subagents to score each variant:

```
Use the schedule-optimizer agent to evaluate all 3 schedule variants:
- schedules/rag-workshop-v1.md
- schedules/rag-workshop-v2.md
- schedules/rag-workshop-v3.md

Then use the comms-reviewer agent to score all 3 announcements:
- comms/rag-workshop-v1-announcement.md
- comms/rag-workshop-v2-announcement.md
- comms/rag-workshop-v3-announcement.md
```

Record the scores:

| Variant | Schedule Score | Comms Score | Total |
|---------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| V1 Community | ___/10 | ___/10 | ___/20 |
| V2 Deep-dive | ___/10 | ___/10 | ___/20 |
| V3 Workshop-lab | ___/10 | ___/10 | ___/20 |

## Step 4: Select the Winner (5 min)

```
Based on the evaluation scores, select the best variant for the RAG Workshop.
Copy the winning files to:
- events/rag-workshop-final.json
- schedules/rag-workshop-final.md
- comms/rag-workshop-final-announcement.md

Explain why this variant won and what elements from the other variants could improve it.
```

**Discussion:** Why did the winner win? Would a different audience or format change the result? This is the key insight — non-deterministic generation + evaluation outperforms a single attempt.

## Step 5: Build the Post-Event System (15 min)

Create the `/post-event` slash command:

```
Create a slash command at .claude/commands/post-event.md that:
1. Takes an event plan file path as $ARGUMENTS
2. Asks for: actual attendance count, what went well, what to improve, speaker feedback, venue feedback
3. Generates a post-event recap including:
   - Summary of the event
   - Attendance vs. estimate comparison
   - Lessons learned
   - Suggestions for next time
   - Draft thank-you email to speakers
   - Draft feedback survey questions
4. Saves the recap to data/past-events/{event-name}-recap.json
5. The recap JSON should include structured fields so future /plan-event calls can learn from it

IMPORTANT: The past-events data must be in a format that /plan-event can read
to improve future event planning. Include fields like: actualAttendees,
feedbackHighlights, improvementAreas, venueRating, formatRating.
```

## Step 6: Close the Feedback Loop (5 min)

Test the full loop — create a mock post-event entry, then plan a new event:

```
/post-event events/rag-workshop-final.json
```

Enter mock feedback (pretend the event happened):
- 35 attendees (estimate was 40)
- WiFi was slow — need venue with better infrastructure
- Workshop exercises were too long, attendees wanted more speaker time
- Great networking session at the end

Now plan a new event and see if the agent uses the feedback:

```
/plan-event "Advanced RAG: Multi-Modal Retrieval"
```

**Check:** Does the new plan account for the lessons learned? Does it suggest a venue with better WiFi? Does it adjust the workshop/talk ratio?

Commit your final system:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: complete MeetupBot with parallel variants and feedback loop"
```

## Checkpoint ✓

You should now have:
- [ ] `briefs/rag-workshop.md` meetup brief
- [ ] 3 competing event plan variants generated in parallel
- [ ] All variants evaluated by schedule-optimizer and comms-reviewer
- [ ] Winning variant selected and saved as final
- [ ] `.claude/commands/post-event.md` working slash command
- [ ] `data/past-events/` with at least one recap entry
- [ ] Feedback loop working — new `/plan-event` calls learn from past events

## Bonus Challenges

1. Create a `/compare-variants` command that generates a side-by-side comparison table of multiple event plan variants
2. Add a `post-event-analyzer` subagent that reads all past events and identifies trends (e.g., "workshops consistently get higher attendance than talks")
3. Build a `/plan-series` command that plans a 3-month meetup series with progressive topics, avoiding speaker and venue repetition

## Congratulations!

You've built a complete MeetupBot that:
- **Plans** events with structured data and venue/speaker matching
- **Schedules** talks with conflict resolution and energy management
- **Communicates** with audience-aware announcements and personalized outreach
- **Optimizes** through specialist subagents (schedule optimizer, comms reviewer)
- **Automates** quality checks through lifecycle hooks
- **Competes** by generating parallel variants and selecting the best
- **Learns** from post-event feedback to improve future planning

These patterns — structured output, context engineering, specialist subagents, automated hooks, parallel generation, and feedback loops — transfer to any agent you build next.
